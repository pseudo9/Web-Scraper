# Web Scraper Book Data
This project is a web scraper designed to extract book information from the website "Books to Scrape" and store the data in both a CSV file and a MongoDB database. The scraper uses `requests` to fetch web pages, `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content, and `pandas` for data handling. Logging is used for tracking the scraping process and handling exceptions.
